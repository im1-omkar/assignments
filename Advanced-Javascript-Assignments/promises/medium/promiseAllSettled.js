// Problem Description – Polyfill for Promise.allSettled

// You are required to implement a polyfill for Promise.allSettled. 
// The function should accept an array of Promises and wait for all of them to either resolve or reject.
// It must return a Promise that resolves with an array of result objects describing the status and value or reason of each Promise.
