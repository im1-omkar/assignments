// Problem Description – promiseAny(promises)

// You are required to implement a function named promiseAny that accepts an array of Promises. 
// The function should return a new Promise that resolves immediately when any one of the input promises resolves successfully. 
// If all the promises reject, the returned Promise should reject with an error.
