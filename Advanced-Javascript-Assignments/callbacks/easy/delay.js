// Problem Description – delay(ms, value)

// You are required to write a function named delay that takes two parameters: a time duration in milliseconds and a value. 
// The function should return a Promise that waits for the given time and then resolves with the provided value.

/***  DONE   */

function delay(ms, value, callback) {
    setTimeout(()=>{
        callback(null,value)
    },ms)
