// Problem Description – Parallel Execution of Async Functions
//
// You are given an array of asynchronous functions. Your task is to execute
// all of them at the same time (in parallel).
//
// The function should return a promise that resolves to an array of
// resolved values in the same order as the input functions.
//
// If any of the asynchronous functions reject, the returned promise
// should immediately reject with that error.
